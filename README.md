4. Resources

## Background

This blog post and the following disussion are going to be focused on privacy. 

We'd like to hear your thoughts on privacy.

Perhaps you've already ruminated on this topic. However, for those of you who do not yet have an opinion on the subject, take a look at the articles in the resources section or feel free to research the topic yourself!

## Instructions - Pt. 1

Answer as many of these questions as you can in your blog post:

* Is privacy important if you have nothing to hide?
* Are Google/Facebook evil?
* Does the government (NSA for example) have a responsibility to protect us from ourselves?
* Do programmers have a responsibility to make sure they build tools that are private by default or is it each individuals responsibility to take steps to protect their privacy only if they feel they need it?
* Does wanting privacy imply you have something to hide?
* If we’re only looking at metadata (who called whom when) and not the content of someones communication is that a violation of privacy?

When you are finished writing, remember to proof-read for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and add your post to `lib/blog_post.txt`. Save, then run your testing suite and make sure it passes. Finally, add, commit, and submit a pull request, just as you would a typical lab.

## Instructions - Pt. 2

On Tuesday morning, take a look at a fellow student's pull request. Read what they wrote for this assignment and respond to it by making a comment on their pull request. 

Should you notice any spelling, grammatical, or structure errors, let them know as well, though this should be treated as more of an afterthought than the focus of your comment.
